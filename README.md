# EconAnalysis
Economic analysis of the project (e.g. landings model and discrete choice model)

## Landing model (paper draft: econ_landings_paper.pdf)
In this paper we analayze how probability of precense of squid and sardine affects landings of these two species, taking into consideration closures and no-fishing decision. 
Interralation between species come from their probability of precense. 

+ Work to do...
  + Do model with closure years perform better? Answer: NO
  + What is the best way to incorporate ACL? Nonlinear function with a cap? Directly in the linear model? Censored data?
  + Make predictions!... Read [Making prediction from stan models in R](https://medium.com/@alex.pavlakis/making-predictions-from-stan-models-in-r-3e349dfac1ed)

## Discrete Choice Model (paper draft: econ_disc_choice_paper.pdf)
Estimation of a mixed logit for location/species decision using PacFIN vessel data and Google Fishing Watch spatial location.
