# EconAnalysis
Economic analysis of the project (e.g. landings model and discrete choice model)

## Landing model (paper draft: econ_landings_paper.pdf)
In this paper we analayze how probability of precense of squid and sardine affects landings of these two species, taking into consideration closures and no-fishing decision. 
Interralation between species come from their probability of precense. 

+ Work to do...
  + Do model with closure years perform better?
  	+ How to compare models with different observations? (In bayesian analysis. I was using LOO criteria).

## Discrete Choice Model (paper draft: econ_disc_choice_paper.pdf)
Estimation of a mixed logit for location/species decision using PacFIN vessel data and Google Fishing Watch spatial location.
